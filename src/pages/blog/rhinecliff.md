I am finishing this web site version, and writing this post on the way to woodstock, ny, by way of the rhinecliff station. Views of the hudson on one side, and a mere half dozen or so stops to our destination. a truly beautiful part of the country.

unplugging has often been something I'm generall poor at. when I disembark the train, the laptop will close for around 72 hours.

I've moved past the bloat of this website, initially starting as a gatsby.js site with a pretty heavy ui library on top, I think this iteration with no external react libraries built with next.js will be a much more suitable long term solution. it's not quite as stripped down as [paul graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/index.html) would like, but it should do.

p.s. if your website doesn't work on a half-width browser on a 13'' macbook at 100% size, you're the bane of my existence, and should resolve it immediately.
